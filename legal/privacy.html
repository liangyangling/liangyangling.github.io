<p>This privacy policy applies to the Gephi NGO Web sites and services.</p>
<h3 id="visitors">Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Except as described below, Gephi NGO does not collect or require visitors to its Web sites to furnish personally-identifying information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Like most Web site operators, Gephi NGO does collect non-personally-identifying information that web browsers and servers typically make available, which are the browser type, language preference, referring site, and date and time of each visitor request. Gephi NGO also collects potentially-personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally-identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.</p>
<p>Gephi NGO’s purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how Gephi NGO’s visitors use its Web sites. To that end, Gephi NGO may share potentially-personally-identifying information with its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations. Gephi NGO may also release non-personally-identifying information about visitors (e.g., by publishing a report on Web site usage trends). Otherwise, Gephi NGO will not publicly release potentially-personally-identifying information except under the same circumstances as Gephi NGO releases personally-identifying information. Those circumstances are explained below.</p>
<p>When you visit the Gephi NGO web sites and use our services, you agree that:</p>
<p>Gephi NGO may process your personal data. We may give access to your personal data Gephi NGO as necessary to provide our services on our website(s).</p>
<p>Gephi NGO process your personally-identifying information to deliver the services Gephi NGO provides according to the principles laid down in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 id="community">Community Members</h3>
<p>Certain members of the Gephi community (contributors, customers, etc.) choose to interact with Gephi NGO in ways that require Gephi NGO and others to know more about them. The amount and type of information that Gephi NGO gathers from those members depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, members who wish to post content to certain portions of Gephi NGO’s Web sites or participate in live chat session(s) are asked to provide usernames that identify that content as having been posted by a particular member. Gephi NGO collects personally-identifying information only insofar as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the community member’s interaction with Gephi NGO.</p>
<p>Gephi NGO is an open organization that believes in sharing as much information as possible about its products, its operations and its associations. Accordingly, community members should assume – as should most folks who interact with Gephi NGO – that any personally-identifying information provided to Gephi NGO will be made available to the public. There are three broad exceptions to that rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gephi NGO does not make publicly available information that is used to authenticate users the publication of which would compromise the security of Gephi NGO’s Web sites (e.g., passwords).</li>
<li>Gephi NGO collects personally-identifying information used to organize events that community members attend. The information collected via a web form is not used for other purposes than organizing the logistics of events organized by Gephi NGO. The data collected is kept for a period of five months and was officially declared to CNIL, the French non-profit organization in charge of enforcing the <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/index.php?id=41" class="external">Data Protection Act</a>and European directives regarding the protection of individuals with regards to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. Users have the right to ask to review, correct, as well as delete their personally-identifying information stored in this application by contacting <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0063\u006f\u006e\u0074\u0061\u0063\u0074\u0040\u0067\u0065\u0070\u0068\u0069\u002e\u006f\u0072\u0067';void 0"><script type="text/javascript">document.write('\u0063\u006f\u006e\u0074\u0061\u0063\u0074\u0040\u0067\u0065\u0070\u0068\u0069\u002e\u006f\u0072\u0067')</script>contact@gephi.org</a>.</li>
<li>Gephi NGO does not make publicly available information that it specifically promises at the time of collection to maintain in confidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Outside those three contexts, users should assume that personally-identifying information provided through Gephi NGO’s Web sites will be made available to the public.</p>
<h3 id="interactive">Interactive Product Features</h3>
<p>Certain Gephi NGO products contain features that report, or that permit users to report, the user’s usage patterns and problems – whether caused by Gephi NGO’s software, third-party software, or third-party Web sites to Gephi NGO. The reports generated by these features typically include non-personally-identifying information such as the configuration of the user’s computer and the code running at the time the problem occurred. Some of these features give users the option of providing personally-identifying information, though none of these features require it. Some Gephi NGO software features that do permit users to provide personally-identifying information advise, in advance, that such information will not be made publicly available. Gephi NGO analyzes the information provided by these interactive product features to develop a better understanding of how its products are performing and being used. It does not use the information to track the usage of its products by identifiable individuals.</p>
<h3 id="protection">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Where Gephi NGO has collected personally-identifying information subject to one of the three exceptions described in the Community Members section, above, it discloses that information only to those of its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations, that need to know that information in order to process it on Gephi NGO’s behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to others.  Some of those employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Gephi NGO’s Web sites, you consent to the transfer of your information to other countries, such as the United States, which may provide a different level of data protection than your home country.  Gephi NGO does not rent or sell such information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations, as described above, Gephi NGO discloses such information only when required to do so by law, or when Gephi NGO believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Gephi NGO, members of the Gephi community, or the public at large. Gephi NGO takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of such information.</p>
<h3 id="updating">Updating of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Gephi NGO permits users to freely review, update, correct, and suppress their personally-identifying information as maintained by Gephi NGO. To do so, users should look for links or contact information available on whichever Gephi NGO Web sites store the relevant information. Users have the right to ask to review, correct, as well as delete their personally-identifying information stored in web applications managed by Gephi NGO by contacting <em>contact AT gephi DOT org</em></p>
<h3 id="cookies">Cookies and Tracking Pixels</h3>
<h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a Web site stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the Web site each time the visitor returns. Most major Web sites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the Web site at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a Web site to “recognize” a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in Gephi NGO cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with Gephi NGO and, where applicable, its third-party service provider.</p>
<h4>What Are Tracking Pixels?</h4>
<p>Tracking pixels (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help Web site operators understand how visitors interact with their Web sites. A tracking pixel is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a tracking pixel allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tracking pixel. It makes it easer to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a Web site.</p>
<h4>How We Use Cookies and Tracking Pixels.</h4>
<p>Gephi NGO’s Web sites use cookies to help Gephi NGO identify and track visitors, their usage of Gephi NGO Web sites, and their Web site access preferences across multiple requests and visits to Gephi NGO’s Web sites. The Web sites, and advertisements that the Gephi NGO may run occasionally on third‑party advertising networks, also may use tracking pixels for these purposes. The basic idea is to gather aggregate data about how people use the Gephi NGO Web sites. The term usually used to describe this is “web analytics” and the cookies and tracking pixels are the tools by which a website owner collects this web analytics data.</p>
<p>Gephi NGO will use the web analytics data only to determine aggregate usage patterns for our Web sites as described above. The Gephi NGO Web sites do this by using either its own internal analytics software or by sending this information to a third-party service provider to help Gephi NGO analyze this data and the Gephi NGO Web sites using third-party web analytics tools are listed <a href="/third-party/" class="external">here</a>. Gephi NGO has agreements with its third-party service providers that they will not share this information with others or use the information for purposes other than to maintain the services they provide to Gephi NGO. It is possible to link cookies and tracking pixels to personally-identifying information, thereby permitting Web site operators, including our third-party analytics providers, to track the online movements of particular individuals. Gephi NGO does not do so and its third-party service providers are not allowed to correlate Gephi NGO data with any other data.</p>
<p>Gephi NGO uses the information provided by cookies and tracking pixels to develop a better understanding of how Gephi NGO’s visitors use Gephi NGO’s Web sites, and to facilitate those visitors’ interactions with Gephi NGO’s Web sites. Gephi NGO may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally-identifying information or potentially-personally-identifying information.</p>
<p>How to Control the Use of Cookies. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Gephi NGO visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by Gephi NGO, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to Gephi NGO’s Web sites. Certain features of Gephi NGO’s Web sites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3 id="opt-out">Opt-out Procedures</h3>
<p>If you do not want to allow your session visitation information on the Gephi NGO Web sites to be aggregated and analyzed by Gephi NGO (or its third-party analytics providers, if you are using www.gephi.org) you may utilize the following <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/opt-out.html" class="external">opt-out mechanisms listed here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Gephi NGO may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be reflected on this page. Substantive changes will also be announced through the standard mechanisms through which Gephi NGO communicates with the Gephi community, including Gephi NGO’s <a href="http://wiki.gephi.org/index.php/MailingList">mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>By using the Web sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, please do not use the Web sites.  You can determine when this privacy policy was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of this page.  Any changes to this privacy policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised privacy policy on the Web sites.  By using the Web sites following any changes, you accept the revised privacy policy then in effect.</p>
