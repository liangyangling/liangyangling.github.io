<p><strong>Gephi : An Open Source Software for Exploring and Manipulating Networks</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gephi is an open source software for graph and network analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p><strong>Using Computer Games Techniques for Improving Graph Viz Efficiency</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gephi is a modular and extensible open-source network visualization platform. It follows a pragmatic approach for visualization by using two different engines for two different purposes. Large scale graph drawing requires performance and interactivity, but also customization and implementation flexibility. We observed that fulfilling all aspects in a single rendering engine is technically not viable on a long-term view and propose to use different technologies. Gephi project aims to create a sustainable software and technical ecosystem, driven by a large international open-source community, who shares common interests in networks and complex systems. It focuses on visualization and manipulation, simplicity and extensibility.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gephi is a new open-source network visualization platform. It aims to create a sustainable software and technical ecosystem, driven by a large international open-source community, who shares common interests in networks and complex systems. The rendering engine can handle networks larger than 100K elements and guarantees responsiveness. Designed to make data navigation and manipulation easy, it aims to fulfill the complete chain from data importing to aesthetics refinements and interaction. Particular focus is made on the software usability and interoperability with other tools.  A lot of efforts are made to facilitate the community growth, by providing tutorials, plug-ins development documentation, support and student projects. Current developments include Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA) and spigots (Emails, Twitter, Facebook â€¦) import.</p>

<h2>About Network Science</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Network Science is a new and emerging scientific discipline that examines the interconnections among diverse physical, informational, biological, cognitive, and social networks. This field of science seeks to discover common principles, algorithms and tools that govern network behavior. The National Research Council defines Network Science as &#8220;the organized knowledge of networks based on their study using the scientific method.&#8221; In this context, network visualization brings a complementary way to statistical analysis to discover, extract and classify new patterns in network structure and data.</p>
