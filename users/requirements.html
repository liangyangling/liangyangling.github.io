<p>Gephi is a cross-platform application, as it is developed in Java. It was successfully tested on many different architecture, OS and graphical configuration. Gephi requires Java version 6 and later, get it <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Minimum hardware requirements</h3>
<p>500 MHz CPU + 128 MB RAM + OpenGL 1.2<br />
There is no absolute minimum. This is a practical minimum. Performance is a function of graph size.</p>

<p>Note that Gephi has been successfully tested on Netbooks, running on IntelÂ® Atom.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>Gephi uses an OpenGL 3D engine to speed up graph visualization. However a compatible graphic card is required. If your graphic card is  older than 5 years, or if your laptop doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated graphic card, you may have to upgrade your hardware to run Gephi.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re running on Linux, get latest vendor graphical drivers to ensure OpenGL hardware acceleration.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
The current stable version of Gephi will only run with Java 6 or 7 (i.e. not Java 8) on both Windows and Linux. On Mac OS, it works with Java 6 only. See <a href="/users/install#gephi-does-not-start">the installation instructions</a>.

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>
<p>Java 1.6 is unfortunately only available on 64-bit Intel Macs. The community is waiting for a full 1.6 support.</p>
<p>For Macs that can have Java 6, see how to enable it: <a href="/users/install-java-6-mac-os-x-leopard">Install Java 6 on Mac  OS X Leopard</a></p>
<p>Note that Soylatte/OpenJDK isn&#8217;t supported.</p>
